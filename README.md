# My-A-Level-Project
In this repository is the python project I developed during my A Level studies for formal assessment which was marked at 70%. I chose to create a game similar to numberlink, the program will generate a 5x5 square grid with 5 pairs of dots of different colours, the users aim was to connect all corresponding dots together whilst filling all the individual squares.
